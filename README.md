# ImpactsofSeaLevelRise
I participated in the 2024 Data Science Competition at Texas A&amp;M, with a partner.

For our analysis of the surrounding area of San Francisco, we used multiple datasets from various sources: the “Annual mean sea level trends” dataset from OEHHA (California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment), the “Historical Flood Impact” dataset from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), as well as the 1990, 2000, and 2010 census datasets for Marin and San Francisco County from Bay Area Census. We compiled all of the data into a single CSV file which we called “Sea-Level-Change-Impacts.” 

After data exploration, we tested many different regression models and used metrics such as MSE to determine the best model.
